# Floats and positioning elements

## Learning objectives

- Use industry-standard tools (floats) to place elements in the page

### Estimated time: 2h

## Floats

HTML elements are usually blocks that stack upon each other top down, so you will find a new block below the previous one (in the order you have them in the HTML file). `Float` is a CSS property that allows you to "float" elements to the right or to the left. Something that you already know how to do with flexbox, right?

### Why is this important?
Even if the use of floats cases have been reduced with the usage of new techniques like flexbox or grid, it's worth knowing it. For example, when you have to float an image inside a text, the best tool to do it is still a *float*. 
Also, there are plenty of CSS code bases that are using floats. When you need to work on a existing code based on floats you should be able to do it.

## Position

`position` is a CSS property that allows you to place elements on the page. Similar to floats, many position use cases have been taken over by new technologies like flexbox.

### Why is this important?

Again, there are specific use cases that require you to use the `position` property, like positioning an element `fixed` with the page scroll (remember those headers that stick to the top of the page?). Also, they are widely used in existing code bases.
