# Local storage

## Learning objectives

- Use local storage to save user input.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

The web storage API, including local and session storage, allows you to save data persistently in the browser, that is, the data remains even if the user reloads the page or closes the browser.

### Why is local storage important?

As a web developer, you can store user data in the browser in order to improve the user experience. For example, you can save user settings about your service so that the user does not have to introduce them every time. Also, you can store the data while the user is filling a form so they can continue the process from where they left even if they close the browser.
