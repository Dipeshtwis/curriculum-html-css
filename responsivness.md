# Responsive Web Design (RWD) with media queries

## Learning objectives
- Ability to create UIs adaptable to different screen sizes using media queries
- Explain why RWD is important when building a UI

### Estimated time: 2h

## Description
Each website can be opened on a different device and those devices might have different screen sizes. 
With Responsive Web Design, you can create one design and it will automatically adapt itself based on the screen size of the device.

### Why is it important?

Nowadays, buisness owners want to reach out to users on different devices - phones, tablets, computers. You as a web developer should be ready to answer to that need.
Building and maintaining a separate website for each screen size is not an efficient way of achieving that.
