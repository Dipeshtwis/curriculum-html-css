# How does a website work?

## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate a basic understanding of client-server architecture.
- Describe how URLs and DNS work.
- Explain how HTTP requests work.


### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description 

You can are already able to build HTML pages and display them nicely in your browser. At some point, you will want (and you will do it!) to publish it, so it is accessible via the Internet.
Before that happens, let's take a step back and revise how it is possible to display almost every page in your browser.

### Why is it important?

Internet and websites are nowadays a part of daily life.
We do not give a lot of thought to how it is possible that we can access the content that someone creates in a different part of this world.
As a web developer, you should understand how does it work. It will help you to understand your role in this process.

### Discover how websites work

- Watch [this short video explaining what the Client-Server architecture is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwLdKeC8scE). Client-Server architecture is the core concept that you need to understand.
- Learn about different types of Client-Server architecture discussed in the [1-Tier, 2-Tier, 3-Tier architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve82kSSj_Hs) video.
- Consolidate your knowledge by reading [this summary of the Client-Server architecture](https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Client_Server_Architecture).
- Learn about [DNS servers](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/what-is-a-dns-server).
- Learn about [HTTP protocol](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_http.asp https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview).
- To sum up, watch the [How The Web Works - The Big Picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJHvdBlSxug) that connects all of this. 

## Challenge yourself
*Use these questions to check what you learned during this lesson.* 

- Can one machine play the role of client and server at the same time?
- If you are developing a website and run it in your browser, is it an example of the 1-Tier, 2-Tier, 3-Tier Client-Server architecture?
- What can identify any computer that is connected to the Web?
- Why do we need DNS servers?
- What languages and technologies can be "understood" by a browser?
