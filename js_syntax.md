# Basic JavaScript syntax recap

## Learning objectives

- Use basic JavaScript syntax.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

You already know JavaScript as you proved in the Trials. But it is worth a recap on the syntax of teh language, mostly about how to manipulate data structures (arrays and objects).

### Why is refreshing JavaScript syntax important?

In the next lessons and projects you will be using JavaScript a lot. It is important that you refresh your basic Javascript knowledge in order to face the next lessons and projects in a better way.
