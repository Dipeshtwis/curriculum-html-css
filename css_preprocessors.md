# CSS preprocessors

## Learning objectives

- Understand the usefulness of CSS preprocessors.

### Estimated time: 2h

## Description

CSS preprocessors are tools that allow you to write CSS in a more modern and powerful syntax. They include features like variables, nesting, partials or mixings. The workflow to use them has 2 steps
1. you write your styles with a new syntax (e.g., scss or less)
2. you "transpile" the preprocessor code into CSS code so it could be interpreted by your browser

### Why are CSS preprocessors important?

The code that you create with CSS preprocessors is usually better (prevent repetition, better structure, decouple functionality) and easier to maintain than plain CSS. Therefore, they are widely used in the industry, and important tools like Rails, Bootstrap or React are prepared to use them without any extra configuration.
