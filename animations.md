# Animations and transitions

## Learning objectives

- Understand the usefulness of transitions and animation.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

We have the possibility of making transitions and animations in our website to make it more appealing for visitors, and provide them a better user experience.

With *transitions* we can make elements on the page change smoothly while the user is interacting with them. For example, when the user moves the mouse is over an element we can change the font color gradually or make an image grow slightly.

*Animations* do not require an user interaction to start running. With them you can make changes in an element properties and repeat them continuously.
