## Forms
If you have ever used the internet (and you did! ;)) you should know how a form looks like.
Anytime you need to share your name, telephone number, or just your thoughts via the internet, most likely you are using an HTML form.

### Why is it important?

The main purpose of a form is to collect user input and send it to the server where it can be processed and/or stored. Without that user would not be able to interact with the server.

### How to build a good form?

To collect data from your users:
- Check [how to build a form in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form)
- Learn [which kind of inputs you can use](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-forms/)
- Check [how to validate user input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#using_built-in_form_validation)


## User Experience (UX)

If you use correct input types and set up validations, the users of your website will have a very smooth and clear experience.
Designing your entire website and being conscious about the experience of your user is the core of UX.
UX focuses on having a deep understanding of users, what they need, what they value, their abilities, and also their limitations.

### Why is it important?

Websites are tools that are being used by people. They should work in a way that feels natural for people and save them from frustration.
Therefore, the better UX you provide, the bigger value you provide to your users.
