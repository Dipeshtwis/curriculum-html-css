# Animations and transitions exercise

## Learning objectives
- Understand the usefulness of transitions and animation.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will add some transitions and animations to your portfolio website. You will work doing pair programming with your coding partner to implement the changes in both of your projects. Let's make our portfolio more attractive!

### Instructions
- First, you need to create a new brach in your repository for this exercise
- Think about the user experience of your portfolio and how you can improve it using what you learned in the previous session about transitions and animations
  - In what elements can you use transitions to improve the browsing experience in desktop? What properties of those elements make sense to transition?
  - In what elements can you use animations?
- We provide you with some ideas that you can implement
  - A color transition when the user hovers one of the buttons
  - The size of the project images increases slightly when you hover them (tip: use the [CSS scale function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/scale()))
  - The text of the form instructions moves slightly to the right when the user hovers it (tip: use the [CSS translate function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/translate()))
  - Make an animation for the logo of the page, so when you load the page it rotates once (tip: use the [CSS rotate function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/rotate()))
- You should make your own decisions about what transitions and animations you will introduce in your portfolio. Be mindful with the time estimate for this activity and don't plan to do more than you can achieve.
- Once you decide what to do, it is time to implement and make your website even better!
