# Client side validation

## Learning objectives

- Use client-side validation to catch and throw errors in the UI.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

As you know, we use HTML forms to collect user input. In order to make sure that the data is provided in a standard format, we can execute data validations client-side on the browser (as opposed to server-side on the server). There are different types of client-side validation: built in input elements, regular expressions and using JavaScript.

### Why is client side validation important?

In web application, as in any other software applications, the data and its consistency are key. In order to help that we are storing consistent user data in our server we should use data validations in the browser.
