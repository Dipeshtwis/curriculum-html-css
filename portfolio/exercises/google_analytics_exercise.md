# Add Google Analytics

## Learning objectives

- Add Google Analytics to a webpage and use it to track activity on that page.

### Estimated time: 0,5h

## Exercise

There are several reasons you might want to add Google Analytics to your portfolio, but this is the main: Google Analytics will tell you exactly which of your application materials are strongest and which are weakest, which can then tell you exactly how to improve your chances of getting a job. Let’s explain what we mean by that.

Logically, the more jobs you apply to, the more people should visit your portfolio. If your portfolio does not see an increase in visitors, then you can assume that’s because your resume and application aren’t currently strong enough to get a hiring manager’s attention. In that case, start working on improving your resume.

Let’s say that Google Analytics shows that people do start visiting your portfolio, but you never receive requests for interviews. In that case, you can assume that your resume and application are strong, but that your portfolio isn’t showcasing your strength. In that case, you can begin working on expanding portfolio projects or revamping the UI.

Google Analytics will tell you exactly where potential hiring managers might be losing interest.
