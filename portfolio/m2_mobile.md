# Milestone 2 - Mobile version

## Learning objectives
- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.
- Use industry-standard tools (flexbox) to place elements in the page.
- Use industry-standard tools (Grid) to place elements in the page.
- Build a personal portfolio site.

### Estimated time: 4h

## Description
In this second milestone of your portfolio website, you will create the section with the portfolio projects of the mobile website

### Requirements

You will build the "works" section of the mobile website, using the template that you chose. We include screenshot of the Template 1 below, but you should stick to the template that you chose.

Remember to
- Use the appropriate tags for each element (e.g., links, titles, etc.) and use HTML5 semantic tags (e.g., header, nav) over `div`s
- In order to lay out the elements on the page you should **use CSS grid and flexbox** combined (it is mandatory that you use both). 
  
  *Hint*: we recommend you to use grid in teh main container of all the cards, and flexbox to lay out an individual card.
- You don't need to implement the detail modal window that requires JavaScript
- You must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g., font, colors, images, tests, margins) using [the info of the templates in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1).
