# Sneak peek: your portfolio

## Learning objectives
- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

*Your portfolio* is one of the most powerful tools in your software developer toolbox; it’s the easiest way of showing what you’re truly capable of as a developer, and is a quick and simple way for recruiters and hiring managers to get an idea of what you can bring to their teams.

In this project (divided into different milestones) you will be building a website for your portfolio. A portfolio website is a key job searching tool for a web developer, and we want you to start working on it from the beginning of the Microverse program. In this project, you will **replicate exactly one of the portfolio templates** we are providing you. However, during your Microverse journey you will include your own projects in the portfolio in order to use it for job searching.


### What makes a good portfolio

In essence, if you take a look at any of the example portfolios we list below, you’ll see that they each hit those four main points. 
- They are all **simple**: there’s no extraneous information—only basic background information, contact information, and a project showcase. 
- They are all **visual**: they use screenshots, mockups, live demos, and other visual tools to show the viewer what you’re capable of. 
- They are all **thorough**: while the design itself may be simple, they make use of links (both in-text and otherwise) to show extra background information about their work, projects, and history. 
- And they all **look good**: they use 1-3 elegant fonts, focus on 2-3 different colors, use HD images, and use color palettes that look good together.

### Portfolio Templates

We have provided some solid portfolio templates you can choose from. 
Choose the one you like the most. The templates are hosted on Figma - a collaborative UI design tool built in the browser. Please watch the video below to learn how to navigate the templates on Figma.
