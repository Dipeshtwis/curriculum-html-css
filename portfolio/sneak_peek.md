# Sneak peek: your portfolio

## Learning objectives
- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In the set of upcoming projects, you will be building your portfolio website. In the beginning, it might use placeholders instead of real projects.
However, during your Microverse journey, you will be adding examples of your own projects there.


### What makes a good portfolio

Watch the video that explains what makes a good portfolio:

In essence, if you take a look at any of the example portfolios we list below, you’ll see that they each hit those four main points. 
They are all simple: there’s no extraneous information—only basic background information, contact information, and a project showcase. 
They are all visual: they use screenshots, mockups, live demos, and other visual tools to show the viewer what you’re capable of. 
They are all thorough: while the design itself may be simple, they make use of links (both in-text and otherwise) to show extra background information about their work, projects, and history. 
And they all look good: they use 1-3 elegant fonts, focus on 2-3 different colors, use HD images, and use color palettes that look good together.

### Portfolio Templates

If you search long enough, you’ll find thousands of great portfolio designs online. 
We don’t want you to search that long, though! The most important thing right now is creating a portfolio and getting it online. 
You can iterate and improve upon the design later. Right now, the goal is creating a great MVP.


We have provided some solid portfolio templates you can choose from. 
Choose the one you like the most. Again, do not focus on searching for portfolio designs somewhere else. 
Let us narrow down your search, or you will get lost on the internet. The templates are hosted on Figma - a collaborative UI design tool built in the browser. 
Please watch the video below to learn how to navigate Figma and the style guide.
