# Milestone 1 - Setup and mobile version skeleton

## Learning objectives
- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.
- Use industry-standard tools (Flexbox) to place elements in the page.
- Build a personal portfolio site.
- Use images and backgrounds to enhance the look of the website.

### Estimated time: 2.5h

## Description

In this first milestone of your portfolio website, you will

- set up a new repository and prepare it for development using best practices (e.g., linters)
- build the first 3 sections of the mobile website, using the template you chose in the previous step


*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
    - Linter should be set up correctly for this repository.
    - Linter result should be green
    - There should be no custom changes to linter config
- Make sure that you used correct flow ([Github Flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
    - README file should be descriptive
    - Commit messages should be meaningful
    - Pull Request should have a descriptive title telling you what changes are inside.
    - Pull Request should have a short summary describing introduced changes in more details.
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).
    - Branch should have a name of a feature or action (e.g. 'created_sidebar' or 'added_comments_section')
    - Pull Request is made from “feature branch” into the `main` branch

### HTML/CSS requirements
In all the HTML/CSS projects you should follow these guidelines:
- Follow the best practices in this [HTML style guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)
- Use the appropriate tags for each element (e.g., links, titles, etc.) and use HTML5 semantic tags (e.g., header, nav) over `div`s
- Avoid [CSS bad practices](https://speckyboy.com/good-bad-css-practices/)

### Project requirements

- The sections you need to build in this milestone are (we include screenshot of Template 1 below for the refrence , but you should stick to the template that you chose):
    - the toolbar (or header):
    <p align="center">
     <img src="./images/m1_setup/toolbar-mobile.png" alt="Toolbar" />
    </p>

    - the headline section (right after the header):
    <p align="center">
      <img src="./images/m1_setup/headline-mobile.png" alt="Headline" />
    </p>

    - the "About myself" section, placed after the projects and before the contact form:
    <p align="center">
      <img src="./images/m1_setup/about-myself-mobile.png" alt="About myself" />
    </p>
- In order to lay out the elements on the page you should use Flexbox in all the 3 sections
- You don't need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript, like open the menu or the dropdowns
- You must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g., font, colors, images, tests, margins) using [the info of the templates in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1).
- Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.)
