# Milestone 1 - Setup and mobile version skeleton

## Learning objectives
- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.
- Use industry-standard tools (Flexbox) to place elements in the page.
- Build a personal portfolio site.
- Use images and backgrounds to enhance the look of the website.

### Estimated time: 2.5h

## Description

For the first milestone in the process of creating your portfolio website, you will:

- set up a new repository and prepare it for development using best practices (e.g. linters).
- build the first 3 sections of the mobile website using the template you chose in the previous step.


*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config):
    - Linter should be set up correctly for this repository.
    - Linter result should be green.
    - There should be no custom changes to linter config.
- Make sure that you used correct [GitHub Flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md):
    - README file should be descriptive.
    - Commit messages should be meaningful.
    - Pull Request should have a descriptive title explaining what changes are inside.
    - Pull Request should have a short summary describing introduced changes in more detail.
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md):
    - Branch name should describe a feature or action (e.g. 'created_sidebar' or 'added_comments_section').
    - Pull Request is made from 'feature branch' into the `main` branch.


### HTML/CSS requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for HTML & CSS](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements
- For this project, you should use the [HTML&CSS linter](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/html-css)
- The 3 sections you need to build for this milestone are:

    - the toolbar (or header):
    <p align="center">
     <img src="./images/m1_setup/toolbar-mobile.png" alt="Toolbar" />
    </p>

    - the headline section (right after the header):
    <p align="center">
      <img src="./images/m1_setup/headline-mobile.png" alt="Headline" />
    </p>

    - the "About myself" section (placed after the projects and before the contact form):
    <p align="center">
      <img src="./images/m1_setup/about-myself-mobile.png" alt="About myself" />
    </p>
    
We included a screenshot of Template 1 for reference, but you should follow the template that you chose.
    
- In order to lay out the elements on the page you should use Flexbox in all 3 sections.
- You don't need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript, like opening the menu or creating dropdowns.
- You must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g. font, colors, images, tests, margins) using [the templates in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1).
- Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.).
