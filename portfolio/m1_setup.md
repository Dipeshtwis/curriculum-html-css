# Milestone 1 - Setup and mobile version skeleton

## Learning objectives
- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.
- Use industry-standard tools (flexbox) to place elements in the page.
- Build a personal portfolio site.
- Use images and backgrounds to enhance the look of the website.

### Estimated time: 2.5h

## Description
In this first milestone of your portfolio website, you will 
- set up a new repository and prepare it for development using best practices (e.g., linters)
- create the first sections of the mobile website

### Requirements

You will build the first 3 sections of the mobile website, using the template you chose in the previous step. We include screenshot of the Template 1 below, but you should stick to the template that you chose. The sections you need to build in this milestone are:
- the toolbar (or header):
<p align="center">
 <img src="./images/m1_setup/toolbar-mobile.png" alt="Toolbar" />
</p>

- the headline section (right after the header):
<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/m1_setup/headline-mobile.png" alt="Headline" />
</p>

- the "About myself" section, placed after the projects and before the contact form:
<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/m1_setup/about-myself-mobile.png" alt="About myself" />
</p>

In order to implement your website, follow these guidelines:
- Follow the best practices in this [HTML style guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)
- Use the appropriate tags for each element (e.g., links, titles, etc.) and use HTML5 semantic tags (e.g., header, nav) over `div`s
- Avoid [CSS bad practices](https://speckyboy.com/good-bad-css-practices/)
- In order to lay out the elements on the page you should use flexbox in all the 3 sections
- You don't need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript, like open the menu or the dropdowns
- You must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g., font, colors, images, tests, margins) using [the info of the templates in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1).
- Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.)
