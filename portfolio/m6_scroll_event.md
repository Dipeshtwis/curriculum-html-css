# Milestone 7 - Mobile menu

## Learning objectives

- Use basic JavaScript syntax.
- Use JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements.
- Use JavaScript events.

### Estimated time: 3h

## Description

For this milestone of your portfolio website, you will implement the mobile menu using your recently acquired JavaScript knowledge.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [GitHub flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### HTML/CSS & JavaScript requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for HTML & CSS](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).
- Follow our list of [best practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

- For this project, you should add the [JavaScript linter](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/javascript).
- In mobile, implement the following features:
  - When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button, the mobile menu appears.
  - When the user clicks (or taps) the close (X) button, the mobile menu disappears.
  - When the user clicks (or taps) any of the mobile menu options, the mobile menu disappears.

We included a screenshot of Template 5 for reference, but you should follow the template that you chose.

- You must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g., font, colors, images, tests, margins) using [the templates in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1).

- **You need to use pair-programming for this project. We will check to see if both partners submitted code by looking at the commit history for each project. Therefore you need to implement the above features in all of the portfolios in your pair-programming group.**

### Need a big picture?

Remind me about [the big picture of this project](./sneak_peek.md).

## Code review

Follow [these steps](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/how_to_ask_for_a_code_review.md) to request a code review of your project.

Each of you needs to request a code review individually.

## Submit your project

After the final approval from a code reviewer, you need to submit your project.
[Read this FAQ for a reminder on how to submit your project.](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234)
Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit your project.

## Additional requirements

*These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, feel free to implement them. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.*

*If you decide to implement these requirements you should do it in a separate pull request. As always, remember to clearly document your decision in GitHub comments.*

- In desktop, when the user scrolls you need to check if the user scrolled to a new section. If so, you should highlight the name of the section in the menu by manipulating the DOM using CSS classes.
