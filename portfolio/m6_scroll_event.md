## Additional requirements

*These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, here are some resources to help you. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.*

- In desktop, when the user scrolls you need to check if the user scrolled to a new section. If so, you should highlight the name of the section in the menu manipulating the DOM (using CSS classes).
